/* ── kevent64 shim: 10.9's kqueue doesn't know KEVENT_FLAG_ERROR_EVENTS or
 * KEVENT_FLAG_IMMEDIATE (both added in 10.10), so when uSockets calls
 * kevent64(kq, changes, n, changes, n, FLAG=0x2, NULL) expecting "only return
 * EV_ERROR events, then return immediately", 10.9 instead:
 *
 *   (a) returns any ready event (e.g. a just-registered writable socket's
 *       EVFILT_WRITE fire). uSockets discards those returns, and because it
 *       registered with EV_ONESHOT the event is consumed and never re-fires
 *       — the main loop never learns the socket is writable, and the HTTP
 *       client sits there for 4 seconds until timing out.
 *
 *   (b) BLOCKS FOREVER when no events are ready (e.g. registering a fresh
 *       timer whose deadline is in the future). Without FLAG_ERROR_EVENTS
 *       semantics and with NULL timeout, kevent64 waits until any event
 *       arrives on the kqueue. uSockets expects the call to return as soon
 *       as the changes are submitted; instead the main thread pins here
 *       forever, starving the event loop. This is the "idle for a few
 *       minutes, next request hangs" symptom — a JS setTimeout or
 *       undici pool timer registers during the quiet window, hits this
 *       path with nothing to fire, and parks the loop.
 *
 * Fix: handle (a) by stashing non-error events for later delivery (see
 * kq_stash below). Handle (b) by forcing a zero timeout on the real call
 * whenever FLAG_ERROR_EVENTS or FLAG_IMMEDIATE is set — that's what modern
 * kqueue does natively when those flags are present, regardless of what
 * the caller passes in `timeout`. */

 * Bun registers EVFILT_MACHPORT with fflags=MACH_RCV_MSG|MACH_RCV_OVERWRITE,
 * expecting the kernel to dequeue the message into event.ext[0] as a
 * side-effect of kevent64 delivery. Modern kernels honour that. The 10.9
 * kernel appears not to — the port's 1-slot queue stays populated after
 * the fire. Bun's us_internal_accept_poll_event is a no-op on kqueue,
 * so nobody else drains either.
 *
 * Consequence: after the first wakeup on `loop->data.wakeup_async`, the
 * port remains full forever. Every subsequent us_internal_async_wakeup
 * (which sends with MACH_SEND_TIMEOUT=0) returns MACH_SEND_TIMED_OUT,
 * which Bun silently treats as "already pending"; no new EVFILT_MACHPORT
 * fire occurs because the port is level-triggered on new messages, and
 * the HTTP client thread parks in kevent64 forever. This is precisely
 * the "first prompt works, second prompt hangs after idle" symptom.
 *
 * Fix: after kevent64 returns an EVFILT_MACHPORT event, do a non-
 * blocking mach_msg(MACH_RCV_MSG|MACH_RCV_TIMEOUT, 0) on that port to
 * actually dequeue the message. We discard the payload — Bun never
 * inspects it either (it's purely a wakeup signal). The port's queue
 * is now empty, so the next sender's mach_msg succeeds and triggers a

     * and `ext[0]` pointing at a user-supplied receive buffer that the

     * thread whose kevent64 has nothing that will ever fire.
     *
     * Fix: at EV_ADD time, create a portset, move the receive port
     * into it, and substitute the portset's name as the kevent's
     * ident. Also strip fflags/ext[] since 10.9 ignores (or rejects)
